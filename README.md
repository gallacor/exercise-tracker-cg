# exercise-tracker-cg
# This is an exercise tracking web app built with a react.js frontend and a Nodejs handling the server side with express.js handling requests and MonogDB storing data in the backend. 
# This app will help users keep track of their exercises performed each day and help them monitor their fitness progress and history. The backend is a REST API that lets users add, delete and edit exercises to their workout history. 
# Future features I am working on include organzining workout history into different exercise days, targeting different muscular groups and also allowing users to see their progression on a specific exercise over time.
